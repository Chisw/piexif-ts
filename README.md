Piexif-ts
========

This repository is forked from [piexifjs](https://github.com/hMatoba/piexifjs) and all praise should go to the creator of this great library.

Fix of the Typescript version of the original [piexifjs](https://github.com/hMatoba/piexifjs) as I was having trouble using it. See original documentation for how to use it.

How to Use
----------

[Read the Docs](https://piexifjs.readthedocs.io/en/2.0/index.html)

Dependency
----------

No dependency. Piexifjs just needs standard JavaScript environment.

Environment
-----------

Both client-side and server-side. Piexifjs is transpiled as Universal Module Definition(https://github.com/umdjs/umd).

Issues
------

Give me details. Environment, code, input, output. I can do nothing with abstract.
